# Hydrow Dashboard

This is the MVP (minimum viable product) code to retrieve Hydrow workout data, parse it, and display it in an HTML-based dashboard.  
The MVP version can be displayed via localhost; the longer-term intention is to build a web-based app for this purpose. 

Further details and instructions are available at www.row1mm.com
